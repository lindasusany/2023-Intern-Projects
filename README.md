# 2023 Intern Projects - Junior Data Analyst

In this repository, you will find details and documentation related to the projects completed during my internship as a Junior Data Analyst.

## Project Overview

As a Junior Data Analyst, the focus of the internship revolved around leveraging Azure Databricks and Azure Data Lake to develop and implement various data models, perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and create insightful visualizations for data-driven decision-making.

### Key Achievements

Here are some of the key achievements and tasks completed during the internship:

1. **Model Development**: Orchestrated the end-to-end development of various models, including time series and H2O models. The output of these models was further utilized in creating Monte Carlo simulation models. You can find related materials in the "Advance Processing Time Forecast" folder and the "Auto Time Series" file.

2. **Data Extraction and Transformation**: Extracted data from Azure Databricks and applied SQL queries to transform it into a usable format. These transformed datasets were then loaded into PowerBI for visualization purposes. A daily refresh frequency was set to ensure up-to-date insights. Details of the SQL queries can be found in the "ETL SQL Queries" file.

3. **Independent Project Management**: Initiated and managed an independent project, starting from documenting the project's deliverables and timeline. The project was completed by creating a comprehensive 20+ page model validation documentation. This documentation serves the dual purpose of knowledge transfer and risk assessment. Samples of the Model Validation Documentation can be found in the "Samples of Model Validation Documentation" folder.
